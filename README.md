## Installation

The best way to view the solutions is to clone the github repository.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidhayden/30-days-of-code.git
```

### Step 2: Run Python Doctests

Solutions created with Python may include *doctests*. You can run the doctest as follows.

```
$ python -m doctest day-07-arrays.py -v
```

By default, doctests won't display anything for passing tests. The *-v* (verbose) option will allow you to see these results.
